# git_workshop

For illustrating various features of the version control system known as git.


## What is git?

Git is a version control system.

From Wikipedia:

> Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

From the official git manual:

> the stupid content tracker

> Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

> Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems)

## Who is Linus Torvalds?

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

Hopefully some of you have heard of this guy before. If you haven't, look him up.

Linus Torvalds is a Helsinkian scuba-diving enthusiast, who is more widely known for developing Linux and releasing it for free to the world back in 1991.

Some facts about Linux today:

> In 2021, 100% of the world’s top 500 supercomputers run on Linux.
> 96.3% of the world’s top 1 million servers run on Linux.
> 90% of all cloud infrastructure operates on Linux...

So Linus is kind of a big deal.

I also just found out that, back in 2010, during a Linux conference in Boston, Linus Torvalds scuba dived in the "Giant Ocean Tank" at the New England Aquarium as a stunt for all his tech fans.

Now Git was created for developing the Linux kernel. There was another VCS they were using called BitKeeper that supposedly withdrew their free version and turned their software proprietary. That's how git came to be, and it is now the dominate VCS, by far.

## Distributed vs Centralized

Git is a distributed VCS. What do I mean by that? There are centralized and distributed VCS.

A Centralized VCS is a system where there exists one main repository (usually on a server) which stores every version of code. Every user commits directly to this main repository, and the other operators in the system are able to see every commit.

A Distributed VCS is a system where each operator has their own repository which stores a complete-in-itself codebase, including it's own full history. The idea being that the codebase, in it's entirety, is mirrored on every developer's computer.

This means, if, in some callosal tragedy, all the computers that ever contained a version of the Wellthy codebase were somehow destroyed except for the one repository that exists on your computer...we could salvage pretty much everything.

This also means that your instance of git, on your laptop which y'all use every day, is in itself a full-fledged VCS.

## So what is Github then?

Github is a hosting service, they provide us with the service of source code management.

We treat it as the source of our development process, but the repository that we use on Github is just another node within our distributed version control system.

There are other hosting services that do this, that offer git-based source code hosting. GtiLabs and BitBucket are the two that I know.

## So how should we use git?
